## 📖 The "Prime" Philosophy

All scripts in this library adhere to three core principles:

1. **Line-by-Line Transparency** - Every function is documented, every decision explained
2. **Hardened for Production** - Robust error handling, security best practices, pre-flight checks
3. **Vendor-Neutral** - Built on industry-standard libraries like Netmiko, Nornir, and TextFSM

> **Mission:** To empower engineers through Python-driven transparency and provide enterprises with hardened automation that eliminates error and accelerates growth.
