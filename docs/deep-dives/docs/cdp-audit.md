# Deep Dive: CDP Network Audit Tool
### "Cisco Python Automation, Explained Line-by-Line."

The **CDP Network Audit Tool** is a high-performance, multi-threaded discovery utility designed to map Cisco topologies with precision. It transforms raw Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) data into structured enterprise intelligence by combining Python automation with hardened security practices.

---

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture
The tool operates as a modular Python application built for reliability and safety in enterprise networks.

1. **Bootstrap & Asset Validation**: The script verifies that TextFSM templates and the Excel report master are present before initiating any SSH connections.
2. **Secure Authentication**: It utilizes a dual-tier credential model (Primary vs. Fallback) and integrates with the Windows Credential Manager.
3. **Threaded Discovery Engine**: A worker pool manages concurrent connections while protecting shared data via thread locks to prevent race conditions.
4. **Data Enrichment**: Post-discovery DNS resolution runs in a dedicated parallel pool to map hostnames to management IPs.
5. **Excel Reporting**: Results are written into a pre-formatted template using an overlay method that preserves existing branding and metadata.

## 🛡️ Hardened Security Logic

### 1. Jump-Host (Bastion) Support
To reach isolated subnets, the script establishes a secure Paramiko `direct-tcpip` channel.
```python
# From NetworkDiscoverer._netmiko_via_jump:
dest_addr = (target_ip, 22)
local_addr = ("127.0.0.1", 0)
channel = transport.open_channel("direct-tcpip", dest_addr, local_addr, timeout=self.timeout)
Line-by-Line: We create a tunnel inside an existing SSH session. This allows Netmiko to communicate with devices that have no direct external access.

Safety: This method avoids needing local listeners or exposing raw management ports on the jump box.

2. The Credential Manager Class
Security is enhanced by leveraging native OS credential stores rather than plaintext files.

Python
# From CredentialManager._read_win_cred:
cred = win32cred.CredRead(target_name, win32cred.CRED_TYPE_GENERIC)
user = cred.get("UserName")
blob = cred.get("CredentialBlob")
pwd = blob.decode("utf-16le") if blob else None
Line-by-Line: The script attempts to find stored credentials for a specific target name. If found, it decrypts the CredentialBlob directly from the Windows store.

Transparency: This provides a professional, "SSO-like" experience while ensuring passwords are never stored in the script or in plaintext on the disk.

⚙️ Discovery Engine: Explained Line-by-Line
Thread-Safe Data Accumulation
Because up to 10 worker threads run simultaneously, the script must manage shared memory safely.

Python
# From NetworkDiscoverer.discover_worker:
with self.visited_lock:
    if host in self.visited:
        continue
    self.visited.add(host)
Line-by-Line: The visited_lock acts as a gatekeeper. Only one thread can check or update the visited list at a time.

The Result: This ensures the script never audits the same switch twice and never gets caught in an infinite loop between two neighboring switches.

Neighbor Filtering Heuristics
The script "thinks" before it decides which device to audit next.

Python
# From NetworkDiscoverer.parse_outputs_and_enqueue_neighbors:
if "Switch" in caps and "Host" not in caps and mgmt_ip:
    if head not in self.visited_hostnames:
        self.visited_hostnames.add(head)
        self.host_queue.put(mgmt_ip)
"Switch" in caps: We target infrastructure nodes by checking CDP capability strings.

"Host" not in caps: We explicitly ignore endpoints like IP phones or printers that show up in CDP but cannot be managed via SSH.

mgmt_ip: If a device does not broadcast its management IP, it is a "dead end" for automation and is skipped to keep the queue clean.

📊 Automated Reporting Logic
The ExcelReporter class populates a professional report that respects your business formatting.

Python
# From ExcelReporter.save_to_excel:
ws1 = wb["Audit"]
ws1["B4"] = site_name
ws1["B5"] = date_now
ws1["B7"] = hosts[0] if hosts else ""
Line-by-Line: The script targets specific metadata cells (B4 to B8) in your master template to record Site Code, Date, and Seed Devices.

Overlay Mode: It uses the if_sheet_exists="overlay" mode to append data from row 12 onward, ensuring all original template headers and styles remain intact.

🚀 Distribution & Execution
Consistent with the Nautomation Prime delivery model, this tool is available in multiple formats:

Zero-Install Portable Bundle: A self-contained package including the Python interpreter and all libraries (Netmiko, Pandas, TextFSM) for use on restricted Windows jump boxes.

Scheduled Docker Appliance: A pre-built container designed for autonomous execution and periodic auditing.

Mission Statement: To empower engineers through Python-driven transparency and provide enterprises with hardened automation that eliminates error and accelerates growth.
