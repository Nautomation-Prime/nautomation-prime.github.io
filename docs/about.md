# About Nautomation Prime

## Our Story

Nautomation Prime was founded to bridge the gap between complex Cisco infrastructure and accessible Python-driven automation. We believe network engineers deserve transparency in their automation tools—no black boxes, no mystery code, just clear, production-ready solutions explained line-by-line.

## What We Do

We provide three core services:

### 🎓 Education
Free, comprehensive technical guides (Deep Dives) that teach network automation through real-world Cisco use cases. Every script is explained line-by-line, every design decision documented.

### 🛠️ Open-Source Tools
Production-hardened Python scripts for common network automation tasks:
- CDP Network Audit
- Access Switch Port Audit
- IOS-XE Upgrade Orchestrator (coming soon)

All tools are available on GitHub under GPL-3.0 licence.

### 💼 Professional Services
Bespoke automation solutions tailored to your specific topology:
- Custom Python scripting
- Portable bundles for restricted environments
- Docker containers for continuous automation
- ISE and Zero Trust automation

---

## Our Philosophy

Every tool, guide, and service adheres to three core principles:

### 1. Line-by-Line Transparency
We explain the *why* behind the code, not just the *what*. Every design decision is documented so you understand your automation completely.

### 2. Hardened for Production
Robust error handling, pre-flight safety checks, enterprise credential management, and thread-safe operations. These aren't "nice to have"—they're essential for critical infrastructure.

### 3. Vendor-Neutral
Built on industry-standard libraries (Netmiko, Nornir, PyATS). Your skills remain portable across vendors and platforms.
