## The "Prime" Philosophy

Every tool and guide adheres to three core principles:

| Principle | What It Means |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Line-by-Line Transparency** | We explain the *why* behind the code, not just the *what*. Every design decision is documented. |
| **Hardened for Production** | Robust error handling, pre-flight safety checks, enterprise credential management, and thread-safe operations. |
| **Vendor-Neutral** | Built on industry-standard libraries (Netmiko, Nornir, PyATS). Your skills remain portable. |
