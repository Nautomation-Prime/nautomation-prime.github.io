# Bespoke Automation Services
### Precision Python Solutions for Cisco Infrastructure

At Nautomation Prime, we bridge the gap between complex infrastructure and streamlined **Python-driven automation**. We provide hardened, production-ready logic designed to eliminate manual error and scale your network operations.

## What We Solve

### 🛠️ Custom Python Scripting
We build bespoke tools tailored to your specific topology. We don't just provide code; we provide transparency.  
* **Automated Provisioning:** Scripts for bulk VLAN, SVI, and Interface configurations.  
* **Fleet Upgrades:** Intelligent Python workflows for IOS and IOS-XE software management.  
* **Compliance Auditing:** Automated "Golden Config" verification against your enterprise standards.

### 🚀 Zero-Install Deployment (Portable Bundles)
We understand that enterprise workstations are often restricted. Our custom solutions can be delivered as **Portable Python Bundles**.  
* **No Installation Required:** Run our automation tools directly from a folder or USB drive without needing to install Python on the local machine.  
* **Full Transparency:** Unlike compiled binaries, our bundles keep the source code visible and auditable, maintaining our commitment to "Line-by-Line" clarity.  
* **Self-Contained:** All required libraries (Netmiko, Nornir, etc.) are pre-packaged within the bundle for a "plug-and-play" experience.  

### 🔐 API & Security Automation (ISE)
Streamline your Zero Trust architecture through programmatic control.  
* **Identity Services Engine (ISE):** Automation of SGT assignments and endpoint profiling via the ERS/OpenAPI.  
* **Automated Policy Enforcement:** Logic-based ACL generation and deployment.  

### 📊 Network Visibility
Turn CLI data into actionable insights with custom Python parsers.  
* **Automated Reporting:** Generate real-time audits for inventory and compliance.  
* **Topology Intelligence:** Discovery scripts that map your physical and logical layers.  

### 🐳 Scheduled "Appliance" Containers (Docker) {:#scheduled-automation}
For enterprises looking for continuous oversight, we provide pre-built Docker containers designed for autonomous execution.  
* **Scheduled Auditing:** Automate "Golden Config" checks or security scans to run daily or weekly without human intervention.  
* **Health Monitoring:** Containers that periodically poll Cisco ISE or IOS-XE devices to alert you to anomalies before they become outages.  
* **Zero-Touch Maintenance:** Our containers come pre-configured with the necessary Python environments and logic—just pull, run, and let the automation work for you.

## Why Choose Nautomation Prime?

Our engagement model is built on three core commitments:

| Commitment | What This Means |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Line-by-Line Transparency** | Every script includes detailed explanations. You understand your automation, not just run it. |
| **Hardened for Enterprise** | Production-grade error handling, pre-flight validation, and security best practices—not shortcuts. |
| **Vendor-Neutral** | Built on Netmiko, Nornir, and PyATS. Your skills remain portable beyond Cisco. |

## Investment & Engagement Model

### How We Price Bespoke Automation

Nautomation Prime operates on a **fixed-fee project basis**—you receive a detailed scope, deliverables list, and total cost estimate upfront. No hourly billing, no surprise invoices, no scope creep.

This model protects both parties: you gain budget certainty, and we're incentivised to deliver efficient, well-architected solutions rather than dragging out billable hours.

#### What Influences Project Cost?

Every engagement is scoped individually, but pricing is typically determined by:

| Factor | Impact on Scope |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Device Count** | A 50-device access layer audit has different complexity than a 500-device campus. |
| **Infrastructure Complexity** | Legacy IOS vs. modern IOS-XE, and distributed topologies require additional validation logic. |
| **Deliverable Type** | A standalone Python script is a different engagement than a Dockerised container with Grafana dashboards. |
| **Integration Requirements** | Connecting to ISE, ServiceNow, or your CMDB adds development and testing overhead. |
| **Documentation Depth** | Line-by-line code explanations (our standard) vs. operational runbooks vs. full knowledge transfer workshops. |

#### Typical Project Ranges

To give you a sense of scale (all prices exclude VAT):

- **Simple Automation Script** (e.g., single-device configuration audit, basic VLAN provisioning): £1,200–£2,500
- **Medium Complexity Tool** (e.g., multi-threaded inventory collection with Excel reporting for 50+ devices): £3,000–£5,500
- **Enterprise-Grade Solution** (e.g., multi-threaded CDP topology mapper, ISE SGT automation, portable Docker containers with full documentation): £6,000–£12,000+

These are **indicative ranges**—actual quotes depend on your specific requirements. A detailed scope call is always free.

### Why Fixed-Fee Pricing Works for Network Automation

**For You:**
- **Predictable budgets** for finance and procurement teams
- **No incentive for inefficiency**—we're motivated to deliver clean, maintainable code
- **Single invoice** per project phase—simpler accounting

**For Us:**
- **Rewards engineering excellence**—the better our architecture, the more efficient our delivery
- **Encourages reusable components**—we build smarter over time
- **Aligns with our philosophy**—"Line-by-Line Transparency" means we document once, properly

### The ROI Case for Python Automation

Industry research consistently shows Python-driven network automation delivers measurable returns:

> **Cisco & ACG Study (2023):** Mature automation deployments achieve **55% OPEX reduction** in network operations.

#### What Does This Mean for Your Team?

Consider a mid-sized UK enterprise with 200 Cisco devices:

- **Manual provisioning time:** ~15 minutes per device for VLAN/SVI changes × 50 changes/year = **125 hours**
- **Compliance audits:** Manual "golden config" checks across 200 devices quarterly = **80 hours/year**
- **Incident response:** CLI data gathering during outages = **40 hours/year** (conservative)

**Total:** 245 hours of repetitive engineering work annually.

At an average senior engineer cost of **£50/hour** (internal cost, not salary), that's **£12,250/year** in manual effort. A £6,000 automation investment pays for itself in **6 months**, then delivers savings every year thereafter.

Beyond cost, you gain:
- **Elimination of human error** in production changes
- **Audit trails** for compliance and security teams
- **Instant runbooks** embedded in the code itself
- **Faster incident response**—data gathering in seconds, not hours
