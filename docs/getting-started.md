## What is Nautomation Prime?

**Nautomation Prime** bridges the gap between complex Cisco infrastructure and streamlined Python-driven automation. We provide:

- **Production-ready automation scripts** explained line-by-line
- **Deep-dive technical guides** that teach you the "why" behind the code
- **Enterprise solutions** including Docker containers and portable bundles
- **Bespoke services** for custom automation needs

---

## 🚀 Quick Start Paths

### I want to learn network automation
Start with our **[Technical Deep Dives](deep-dives/index.md)**. We provide comprehensive guides that explain Python automation concepts alongside real Cisco use cases.

**Recommended Reading Order:**
1. [CDP Network Audit Deep Dive](deep-dives/cdp-audit.md) - Learn about threading, security, and production-grade design

### I want to use pre-built scripts
Check out our **[Script Library](scripts/index.md)**. Each script comes with documentation and GitHub repositories for easy deployment.

**Popular Scripts:**
- [CDP Network Audit Tool](scripts/index.md) - Discover your Cisco topology with line-by-line transparency

### I need custom automation for my environment
Explore our **[Services](services.md)** page. We offer:
- Custom Python scripting tailored to your topology
- Portable bundles for restricted environments
- Docker containers for continuous automation
- ISE and Zero Trust automation

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

Most Nautomation Prime tools require:

- **Python 3.8+** (or use our [portable bundles](services.md#zero-install-deployment-portable-bundles) if Python isn't available)
- **Network access** to your Cisco devices
- **Credentials** for device authentication
- **SSH enabled** on target Cisco devices

---

## 🔐 Security & Credentials

Nautomation Prime follows enterprise security best practices:

✅ **Credentials stored in OS credential managers** (not plaintext files)  
✅ **No hardcoded secrets** in scripts  
✅ **Secure jump-host support** for isolated networks  
✅ **Full source code transparency** (no compiled binaries)

## 📚 Core Concepts

### The "Prime" Philosophy

Every tool, script, and guide adheres to three principles:

1. **Line-by-Line Transparency**
   - We explain the *why* behind the code, not just the *what*
   - Every design decision is documented
   - You'll understand your automation, not just run it

2. **Hardened for Production**
   - Robust error handling
   - Pre-flight safety checks
   - Enterprise-grade credential management
   - Thread-safe concurrent operations

3. **Vendor-Neutral**
   - Built on industry-standard libraries (Netmiko, Nornir, PyATS)
   - Your skills remain portable
   - Scripts can scale beyond Cisco if needed

## 🛠️ Common Tasks

### Deploy the CDP Network Audit Tool
1. Visit the [CDP Audit GitHub repository](https://github.com/Nautomation-Prime/Cisco_CDP_Network_Audit)
2. Read the [Deep Dive guide](deep-dives/cdp-audit.md) for understanding the architecture
3. Follow the README for installation and configuration
4. Run your first discovery against a test device

### Request Custom Automation
1. Document your use case and network topology
2. [Contact Nautomation Prime via LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/nautomationprime)
3. Describe any constraints (e.g., restricted environments, specific platforms)
4. Receive a detailed proposal and timeline

### Use Portable Bundles (No Python Installation)
1. Request a custom bundle through our [services page](services.md#zero-install-deployment-portable-bundles)
2. Download the bundle to your workstation or USB drive
3. Extract and run directly—no installation needed
4. Full source code is included for auditing

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Do I need Python installed to use Nautomation Prime tools?**  
A: Not necessarily! We offer [portable bundles](services.md#zero-install-deployment-portable-bundles) that run without Python installation. Ideal for restricted enterprise environments.

**Q: Can you automate my specific network topology?**  
A: Yes! Our [bespoke services](services.md#bespoke-services) cover custom scripting for any topology. [Contact us](services.md#start-a-consultation) to discuss your needs.

**Q: Are these tools vendor-locked to Cisco?**  
A: Our tools are built on vendor-neutral libraries like Netmiko and Nornir. While designed for Cisco, the patterns you learn apply across other vendors.

**Q: How do I secure my credentials?**  
A: We leverage native OS credential managers (Windows Credential Manager on Windows, Keychain on macOS, etc.). Passwords are never stored in plaintext.
