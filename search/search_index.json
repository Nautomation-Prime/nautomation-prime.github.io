Our bespoke services cover custom scripting for any topology. Contact us via email or LinkedIn to discuss your specific requirements.</p> <p>Q: Are these tools vendor-locked to Cisco? A: Our tools are built on vendor-neutral libraries like Netmiko and Nornir. While designed for Cisco, the patterns and concepts apply across other vendors (Juniper, Arista, etc.).</p> <p>Q: How do I secure my credentials? A: We leverage native OS credential managers (Windows Credential Manager, Keychain on macOS, pass on Linux). Passwords are never stored in plaintext files or hardcoded in scripts. When you run a script like CDP Network Audit for the first time, it will prompt you to save your credentials to Windows Credential Manager\u2014just enter your username and password, and the script will store them securely. Future runs will use the stored credentials automatically.</p> <p>Q: What about support and updates? A: All tools are maintained on GitHub with active development.

Catalyst Center (DNA Center) = Enhanced Capabilities","text":"<p>Couldn't I Just Use Catalyst Center Instead?</p> <p>This is a common and valid question. Cisco Catalyst Center (formerly DNA Center) provides excellent GUI-driven software upgrade capabilities with Software Image Management (SWIM). So why build a Python orchestrator?</p> <p>The answer: Python and Catalyst Center are complementary, not competing solutions. Python orchestration enhances and extends Catalyst Center's capabilities rather than replacing them.</p> <p>Key Limitations of Catalyst Center Alone:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Workflow Customization Constraints</p> <ul> <li>Catalyst Center provides standardized workflows optimized for common use cases, but enterprises often require bespoke logic (e.g., custom pre-checks, integration with legacy ticketing systems, specific maintenance window rules).</li> <li>Python orchestrators enable fully customized workflow stages, conditional logic, and integration points that may not be exposed via the Catalyst Center GUI or standard APIs.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Multi-Vendor and Hybrid Environments</p> <ul> <li>Catalyst Center is Cisco-centric by design. Enterprises with multi-vendor networks (e.g., Cisco + Arista, Juniper, Palo Alto) require orchestration that spans platforms.</li> <li>Python scripts using libraries like Netmiko, Nornir, or NAPALM can manage heterogeneous device estates with unified logic.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Granular Control and Rollback Flexibility</p> <ul> <li>While Catalyst Center supports upgrades and basic rollback, Python orchestrators provide fine-grained control over every command executed, error handling strategies, and multi-tier rollback mechanisms (image + config + validation).</li> <li>Critical for high-stakes environments where \"good enough\" automation isn't acceptable.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Excel/CSV Source-of-Truth Integration</p> <ul> <li>Many enterprises rely on Excel, CSV, or legacy CMDBs as their authoritative inventory. Python orchestrators can directly consume and update these sources.</li> <li>Catalyst Center requires devices to be onboarded and managed within its inventory system, which may not align with existing operational workflows.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Cost and Licensing</p> <ul> <li>Catalyst Center requires licensing and infrastructure (dedicated appliance or VM cluster). For smaller environments or specific use cases, a Python orchestrator offers zero-cost flexibility.</li> <li>Python scripts can be version-controlled in Git, shared across teams, and deployed without additional licensing overhead.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Edge Case and Platform-Specific Handling</p> <ul> <li>Python orchestrators can implement highly specialized logic for edge cases (e.g., StackWise version mismatch recovery, FPGA upgrades on NCS platforms, legacy ISR router nuances) that may not be fully supported by Catalyst Center's standardized workflows.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>How Python Orchestrators Enhance Catalyst Center:</p> <p>Synergistic Integration Strategies</p> <p>1. Use Catalyst Center as the Source-of-Truth</p> <ul> <li>Leverage Catalyst Center's Intent API to query device inventory, software compliance status, and health metrics.</li> <li>Python orchestrators can consume this data via REST APIs, eliminating the need to maintain separate inventory files.</li> <li>Example: <code>GET /dna/intent/api/v1/network-device</code> retrieves device details; Python script uses this to build upgrade candidates list.</li> </ul> <p>2. Trigger Python Workflows from Catalyst Center Events</p> <ul> <li>Use Catalyst Center's Event Management (Eastbound) APIs to trigger Python orchestrators when specific conditions occur (e.g., device out of compliance, critical CVE detected).</li> <li>Python script executes custom pre-checks, stages images, and performs upgrades, then reports status back to Catalyst Center via REST APIs.</li> </ul> <p>3. Hybrid Orchestration: Catalyst Center + Python</p> <ul> <li>Use Catalyst Center for standard, low-risk upgrades (e.g., access switches during maintenance windows).</li> <li>Reserve Python orchestrators for high-stakes, complex scenarios (e.g., core routers, dual-SUP chassis, StackWise Virtual, or devices requiring custom validation logic).</li> </ul> <p>4. Extend Catalyst Center with Custom Integrations</p> <ul> <li>Python scripts can integrate Catalyst Center with third-party tools not natively supported (e.g., ServiceNow, Slack, legacy CMDB systems, custom dashboards).</li> <li>Example: Python orchestrator fetches upgrade candidates from Catalyst Center, cross-references with ServiceNow change tickets, executes upgrades, and updates both systems.</li> </ul> <p>5. Reporting and Analytics</p> <ul> <li>Catalyst Center provides robust reporting, but Python orchestrators can generate bespoke reports tailored to specific compliance, audit, or operational requirements.</li> <li>Example: Export upgrade history to Excel with custom formatting, compare against baseline configurations, and highlight deviations.</li> </ul>","tags":["Coming Soon","IOS-XE","Automation","Software Upgrade","Python","Orchestration"]},{"location":"coming-soon/IOS-XE%20Software%20Upgrade%20Orchestrator/#real-world-use-case-python-catalyst-center","title":"Real-World Use Case: Python + Catalyst Center","text":"<p>An enterprise network team manages 5,000 Catalyst switches via Catalyst Center.

Python Orchestrator Generates Dynamic Ansible Inventories</p> <ul> <li>Python reads device list from Excel, applies business logic (e.g., filter by maintenance window, exclude devices with active incidents), and generates Ansible inventory files.</li> <li>Ansible playbooks consume dynamically generated inventories, ensuring only eligible devices are targeted.</li> </ul> <p>4. Use Ansible for Multi-Vendor Normalization, Python for Cisco-Specific Logic</p> <ul> <li>Ansible's multi-vendor module support (IOS, NX-OS, Junos, Arista) handles cross-platform command execution.</li> <li>Python orchestrator implements Cisco IOS-XE-specific upgrade logic (Install Mode, ISSU detection, StackWise coordination) not covered by generic Ansible modules.</li> </ul> <p>5. Ansible Playbooks as Reusable Components in Python Workflows</p> <ul> <li>Develop modular Ansible playbooks for reusable tasks (backup configs, verify image hash, check flash space).</li> <li>Python orchestrator calls these playbooks as needed, combining them into bespoke upgrade workflows tailored to specific device groups or scenarios.</li> </ul>","tags":["Coming Soon","IOS-XE","Automation","Software Upgrade","Python","Orchestration"]},{"location":"coming-soon/IOS-XE%20Software%20Upgrade%20Orchestrator/#real-world-use-case-python-ansible","title":"Real-World Use Case: Python + Ansible","text":"<p>A network team manages upgrades for 3,000 Cisco devices (mix of IOS, IOS-XE, NX-OS).

Unlike Ansible (which uses YAML-based playbooks), Nornir is Python-native\u2014you write automation logic in Python itself, giving you the full power of a programming language without abstraction layers.</p> <p>Why it's less known: Nornir is newer (first released in 2018) and targets a more technical audience (network engineers who code in Python). It lacks the marketing presence of Ansible/Red Hat, but has become the framework of choice for sophisticated network automation engineers who need Python's flexibility with built-in scalability.</p> <p>Why Nornir is Ideally Suited for IOS-XE Upgrade Orchestration:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Python-Native Design</p> <ul> <li>No DSL Abstraction: You write pure Python\u2014no need to learn YAML syntax, Jinja2 templating quirks, or Ansible-specific modules. If you know Python, you know Nornir.</li> <li>Full Language Features: Use classes, decorators, context managers, async/await, and any Python library (openpyxl, pandas, requests) directly in your automation logic.</li> <li>Why It Matters: IOS-XE upgrades require complex conditional logic, state management, and error handling that's easier to express in Python than YAML-based playbooks.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Built-In Parallelization and Thread Management</p> <ul> <li>Automatic Concurrency: Nornir executes tasks across devices in parallel using thread pools (configurable workers). No need to manually manage threading like you would with raw Netmiko + threading.</li> <li>Granular Control: Set concurrency limits per task (e.g., 50 concurrent connections for pre-checks, but only 10 for image transfers to avoid network saturation).</li> <li>Why It Matters: Upgrading hundreds of devices requires efficient parallelization. Nornir handles this out-of-the-box with better control than Ansible's <code>serial</code> or <code>forks</code> settings.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Flexible Inventory System</p> <ul> <li>Multiple Inventory Sources: Nornir supports SimpleInventory (YAML), NetBox, Ansible inventory, or custom inventory plugins. You can also build inventories programmatically from Excel, CSV, or databases.</li> <li>Rich Host Data: Each host object carries arbitrary data (groups, custom attributes, credentials), accessible in tasks.</li> <li>Why It Matters: For Excel-driven workflows, you can write a custom Nornir inventory plugin that reads directly from Excel, mapping columns to host attributes (platform, target version, maintenance window).</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Plugin Architecture for Extensibility</p> <ul> <li>Task Plugins: Encapsulate reusable operations (e.g., <code>netmiko_send_command</code>, <code>napalm_get</code>, custom <code>ios_xe_upgrade_install_mode</code>).</li> <li>Connection Plugins: Manage device connections (Netmiko, NAPALM, Scrapli, or custom SSH implementations).</li> <li>Inventory, Processor, and Runner Plugins: Customize every aspect of Nornir's behavior.</li> <li>Why It Matters: You can develop custom plugins for IOS-XE-specific upgrade operations (StackWise coordination, dual-SUP handling) and reuse them across projects.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Integrated Result Object and Error Handling</p> <ul> <li>Structured Results: Every task returns a <code>Result</code> object with success/failure status, output, exception details, and host info. Results are aggregated in a <code>AggregatedResult</code> object for easy analysis.</li> <li>Granular Error Handling: Continue executing tasks even if some hosts fail (<code>on_failed=True</code>), or halt execution on first failure. Analyze failed hosts and retry selectively.</li> <li>Why It Matters: Upgrades involve multi-stage workflows where you need to track which devices succeeded/failed at each stage (pre-check, transfer, upgrade, verify) and handle partial failures gracefully.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Integration with Netmiko, NAPALM, and Scrapli</p> <ul> <li>Leverage Existing Libraries: Nornir plugins provide seamless integration with Netmiko (CLI automation), NAPALM (structured data retrieval), and Scrapli (fast, modern SSH library).</li> <li>Best of Both Worlds: Use Netmiko for raw CLI commands, NAPALM for standardized getters (facts, interfaces), and Scrapli for performance-critical operations.</li> <li>Why It Matters: You don't reinvent the wheel\u2014Nornir orchestrates existing, battle-tested libraries while providing structure, parallelization, and result handling.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>How Nornir Enhances This Python Orchestrator:</p> <p>Integration Strategies</p> <p>1. Use Nornir as the Core Execution Engine</p> <ul> <li>Replace custom threading/multiprocessing code with Nornir's built-in parallelization.</li> <li>Define upgrade workflow stages as Nornir tasks: <code>pre_check_task()</code>, <code>transfer_image_task()</code>, <code>upgrade_task()</code>, <code>verify_task()</code>.</li> <li>Execute tasks across device inventory with automatic concurrency management: <code>nr.run(task=pre_check_task)</code>.</li> </ul> <p>2. Custom Nornir Inventory from Excel</p> <ul> <li>Develop a custom Nornir inventory plugin that reads device list, credentials, and upgrade parameters from Excel.</li> <li>Map Excel columns to Nornir host attributes: <code>hostname</code>, <code>platform</code>, <code>target_version</code>, <code>maintenance_window</code>, etc.</li> <li>Filter inventory dynamically: <code>nr_filtered = nr.filter(platform=\"catalyst9k\", maintenance_window=\"tonight\")</code>.</li> </ul> <p>3. Encapsulate IOS-XE Upgrade Logic in Nornir Tasks</p> <ul> <li>Create custom Nornir tasks for platform-specific operations:<ul> <li><code>ios_xe_install_mode_upgrade()</code>: Handles <code>install add</code>, <code>install activate</code>, <code>install commit</code> workflow.</li> <li><code>stackwise_version_check()</code>: Validates all stack members are running same version.</li> <li><code>dual_sup_upgrade()</code>: Coordinates standby-first upgrade logic.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Reuse tasks across different upgrade scenarios and device groups.</li> </ul> <p>4. Leverage Nornir Processors for Logging and State Tracking</p> <ul> <li>Use Nornir's <code>processor</code> framework to automatically log every task execution to Excel, database, or SIEM.</li> <li>Example: Custom processor updates Excel row with upgrade status after each task completes.</li> </ul> <p>5. Conditional Task Execution Based on Results</p> <ul> <li>Analyze <code>AggregatedResult</code> after each stage to determine next steps:     <pre><code>result = nr.run(task=pre_check_task)\nfailed_hosts = [host for host, r in result.items() if r.failed]\nif failed_hosts:\n    # Remove failed hosts from inventory, notify operator\n    nr = nr.filter(~F(name__any=failed_hosts))\nnr.run(task=transfer_image_task)  # Only successful hosts proceed\n</code></pre></li> <li>Implement multi-tier rollback: if post-verification fails, execute rollback tasks only on affected hosts.</li> </ul>","tags":["Coming Soon","IOS-XE","Automation","Software Upgrade","Python","Orchestration"]},{"location":"coming-soon/IOS-XE%20Software%20Upgrade%20Orchestrator/#nornir-vs-raw-python-with-netmikothreading","title":"Nornir vs. Raw Python with Netmiko/Threading","text":"Aspect Raw Python + Netmiko + Threading Nornir + Netmiko Parallelization Manual thread pool management Built-in, configurable workers Inventory Management Custom data structures (lists, dicts) Rich inventory objects with filtering Task Encapsulation Functions scattered across modules Reusable task plugins Result Handling Manual result aggregation Structured <code>Result</code> and <code>AggregatedResult</code> Error Handling Try/except in each thread Integrated failure tracking Code Complexity Higher (threading boilerplate) Lower (framework handles concurrency) Reusability Limited (project-specific) High (plugins, tasks shareable) Learning Curve Python threading/multiprocessing Nornir concepts (tasks, inventory, results)","tags":["Coming Soon","IOS-XE","Automation","Software Upgrade","Python","Orchestration"]},{"location":"coming-soon/IOS-XE%20Software%20Upgrade%20Orchestrator/#real-world-use-case-nornir-powered-upgrade-orchestrator","title":"Real-World Use Case: Nornir-Powered Upgrade Orchestrator","text":"<p>A network team develops an IOS-XE upgrade orchestrator using Nornir:</p> <ol> <li>Custom Excel Inventory Plugin: Reads device list from Excel (hostname, IP, platform, target version, maintenance window).
