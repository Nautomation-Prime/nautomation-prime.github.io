A: We leverage native OS credential managers (Windows Credential Manager, Keychain on macOS, pass on Linux). Passwords are never stored in plaintext files or hardcoded in scripts. When you run a script like CDP Network Audit for the first time, it will prompt you to save your credentials to Windows Credential Manager\u2014just enter your username and password, and the script will store them securely.
