## Our Philosophy

Every tool, script, and guide follows three core principles:

1. **Line-by-Line Transparency** — We explain the *why*, not just the *what*
2. **Hardened for Production** — Enterprise-grade error handling and security
3. **Vendor-Neutral** — Built on industry-standard libraries (Netmiko, Nornir, PyATS)
